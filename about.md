I am a quantative ecologist working with the US Forest Service. I work on a variety of topics, including disease ecology and the environmental dangers of illegal marijuana cultivation.

### More Information

I live in Arcata California. I earned a Masters degree from Humboldt State University in 2015.  My thesis research covered pheromone evolution in Pacific Newts and the role those pheromones may play in the reproductive isolation of the four species in California.
