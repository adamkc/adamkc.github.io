title: Hello Goat World
---

The world is insane and my prescription for making it less insane is goats.  Here's a map showing where one might go to surround themselves with goats.  There are 34 counties in the US with more goats than people.

You can zoom out and see Alaska and Hawaii if you're interested.  You might be wondering why there's no data for Louisiana.  Well. It turns out the USDA  **_misspells louisiana as Louisana._** It has to be a mean joke on Louisiana's educational system.  I could have fixed the typo and added the Louisiana goat data to the map but it's too perfect of an Easter egg to remove.  So there you go. [Here's](https://www.agcensus.usda.gov/Publications/2012/Online_Resources/Ag_Census_Web_Maps/Data_download/index.php) the source of the data if you'd like to check out the typo yourself. 

Probably very related to this post, we had goats growing up.  Here's a photo of them:

I think someday I'll be embarassed by this first post to my blog (and maybe unpublish it) but right now I'm very happy to share knowledge about goats.
